Q. what is an image?
ANS-An image is an array, or a matrix, of square pixels (picture elements) arranged in       columns and rows. 

Q. what is contrast, brightness and hue of Image?
ANS - 1.Contrast is the difference in luminance or colour that makes an object (or its       representation in an image or display) distinguishable.
    2.Image brightness (or luminous brightness) is a measure of intensity after the image has been acquired with a digital camera or digitized by an analog-to-digital converter.
    3.If you draw a intensity on wavelength curve for each pixel in the image, hue refers to the peak of the curve, i.e., at the visible wavelength with the greatest energy from the output. 
    
Q. what is the difference between image processing and computer vision?
ANS - Computer Vision:
    In Computer Vision, computers or machines are made to gain high-level understanding from the input digital images or videos with the purpose of automating tasks that the human visual system can do. It uses many techniques and Image Processing is just one of them.

    Image Processing:
    Image Processing is the field of enhancing the images by tuning many parameter and features of the images. So Image Processing is the subset of Computer Vision. Here, transformations are applied to an input image and an the resultant output image is returned. Some of these transformations are- sharpening, smoothing, stretching etc.
